# Doom-Fire

This project replicates the iconic fire effect used in the loading screen of the PlayStation 1 port of Doom. I decided to implement it in C++ using SFML, both for fun and as a personal challenge since I haven't worked with SFML in a while.

# Dependencies
* SFML 2.6

# How to run
1) ```git clone <repository>```
2) ```mkdir build```
3) ```cd build```
4) ```cmake ../```
5) ```cmake --build .```
6) ```./DoomFire```
7) Don't forget to press the Enter to start the fire effect
8) Enjoy

# Controls
* Press Enter to run the effect
* Press Space to stop the effect
